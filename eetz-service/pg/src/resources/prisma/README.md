# PostGRES with Prisma

This implementation starts down the road of using fully defined SQL models as tables, with id column, and separate columns for firstName, lastName, email, recipes[], invitations[], etc.

This flies directly in the face of preferring a JSONB approach. Types are clearly defined here, and there is little flexibility in the documents as presented, since they are no longer documents.
